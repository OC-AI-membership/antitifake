## What is loxilb

loxilb is an open source hyper-scale software load-balancer for cloud-native workloads. It uses eBPF as its core-engine and is based on Golang. It is designed to power on-premise, edge and public-cloud Kubernetes cluster deployments.

### ðŸ“¦ loxilb aims to provide the following :   
- Service type load-balancer for kubernetes
    * L4/NAT stateful loadbalancer
    * NAT44, NAT66, NAT64 with One-ARM, FullNAT, DSR etc
    * Support for TCP, UDP, SCTP (w/ multi-homing), FTP, TFTP etc
    * High-availability support with hitless/maglev/cgnat clustering
    * Full compliance for K8s loadbalancer Spec
    * Multi-cluster support
-  Extensive and scalable liveness probes for cloud-native environments
-  High-perf replacement for the *aging* iptables/ipvs
-  L7 proxy support
-  Telco/5G/6G friendly features
    * GTP tunnels as first class citizens
    * Optimized SRv6 implementation
    * Support for UL-CL with LB, QFI and other utility extensions

### ðŸ§¿ loxilb is composed of:        
- Bespoke GoLang based control plane components
- [eBPF](https://ebpf.io/) based data-path forwarding
   * Home-grown stack with advanced features like [Conntrack](https://thermalcircle.de/doku.php?id=blog:linux:connection_tracking_1_modules_and_hooks), QoS etc
   * Complete kernel networking bypass
   * Highly scalable with low-latency & high throughput   
- GoLang powered easy to use APIs/Interfaces infra
- Seamless integration with goBGP based routing stack

### ðŸš€ Why choose loxilb?
   
- ```Performs``` much better compared to its competitors across various architectures
    * [Single-Node Performance](https://loxilb-io.github.io/loxilbdocs/perf-single/)  
    * [Multi-Node Performance](https://loxilb-io.github.io/loxilbdocs/perf-multi/) 
    * [Performance on ARM](https://www.loxilb.io/post/running-loxilb-on-aws-graviton2-based-ec2-instance)
    * [Short Demo on Performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJXcM0x6IeQ)
- ebpf makes it ```flexible``` and ```future-proof``` (kernel version agnostic and in future OS agnostic ðŸš§)
- Advanced ```quality of service``` for workloads (per LB, per end-point or per client)
- Includes powerful NG ```stateful firewalling``` and ```IPSEC/Wireguard```support
- Optimized/Custom end-point ```liveness checks at scale```
- Support for ```5G/Edge```  cloud-native workloads
- Works with ```any``` Kubernetes distribution/CNI - k8s/k3s/k0s/kind/OpenShift + Calico/Flannel/Cilium/Weave/Multus etc
- Extensive support for ```SCTP workloads``` (with multi-homing) on k8s
- Dual stack with ```NAT66, NAT64``` support for k8s
- k8s ```multi-cluster``` support ðŸš§
- Runs in ```any``` cloud (public cloud/on-prem) or ```standalone``` environments

  (*ðŸš§: *Work in progress*)
