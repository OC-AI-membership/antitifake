### ðŸ§¿ Antitifake is composed of:       
<!--
- Bespoke GoLang based control plane components
- [eBPF](https://ebpf.io/) based data-path forwarding
   * Home-grown stack with advanced features like [Conntrack](https://thermalcircle.de/doku.php?id=blog:linux:connection_tracking_1_modules_and_hooks), QoS etc
   * Complete kernel networking bypass
   * Highly scalable with low-latency & high throughput   
- GoLang powered easy to use APIs/Interfaces infra
- Seamless integration with goBGP based routing stack
-->


### To-Do :       
- Import SeqDeepFake to antitifake
    * analyze gradio code
    * integrate into app.py
- Use grounding dino for visualize
    * analyze grounding dino and import
- Import other baelines
